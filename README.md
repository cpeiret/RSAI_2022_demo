# RSAI 2022 demo

Hi there! Thank you for checking this repo. Here you will find all the necessary code to reproduce a simplified accessibility score for Stirling. There are three main files here:
- `01_data`: here you will generate a hexagonal tessellation of our study area.
- `02_accessibility`: this is the `R` code to calculate the accessibility score of each of our origins.
- `03_visualisation`: here you will find the code to generate two maps comparing accessibility amongs adults and seniors.

All the data necessary to reproduce this code is located in the folder `data`.
